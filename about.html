            <span id="topic" class="about-title">Beginning in January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has had catastrophic consequences for garment workers around the world.</span>
            <p>Millions of workers have not been paid their full wages during the first three months of the pandemic. By
                considering the evolution of the Covid-19, three waves can be identified.</p>
            <p class="about-tab"><span class="font-regular">01. Origins:</span> the transportation of raw materials from China to other garment producing countries was
                suspended and many factories were forced to close temporarily.</p>
            <p class="about-tab"><span class="font-regular">02. Expansion: </span>The pandemic has spread to Europe and the United States. In response to a sudden drop in
                consumer demand for apparel, brands cancelled and refused to pay for shipments of completed and in
                production orders. As a result, factories were forced to close and dismiss workers en masse. Each time
                factories were forced to close, workers were often sent home without notice or pay from their
                employers.</p>
            <p class="about-tab"><span class="font-regular">03. Persistence:</span> the wave of devastation continues as the virus itself spreads in garment producing
                countries. The impact from the loss of regular pay for millions of garment workers is compounded by the
                fact that most workers only earn poverty wages. As a result of the industry’s low wages, workers are
                unable to accumulate savings and are often in debt.</p>
            <p>In this reality, brands have failed to take meaningful action to improve the industry’s poverty wages.
                Moreover, most garment production is carried out in countries where social protections and unemployment
                benefits are the weakest in the world or where workers are employed informally.</p>
            <hr>
            <span id="source" class="about-title">How many workers were unpaid or underpaid in the most productive countries from march to may 2020?</span>
            <p>The report <span class="font-regular"><a class="about-link" href="https://cleanclothes.org/file-repository/underpaid-in-the-pandemic.pdf/view">Un(der)paid in the pandemic </a></span> published by the <span class="font-regular"><a  href="https://cleanclothes.org/campaigns/pay-your-workers" class="about-link">Clean Clothes Campaign</a></span> team research, concerns
                the wage gap of 50 million workers in seven countries during the first phase of Covid-19 pandemic. It
                estimates that garment workers worldwide owe 5.78 billion USD in wages for the first three months of the
                pandemic alone.</p>
            <img src="assets/media/graphics/dataset-about-01.jpg">
            <p>The countries showed similar developments: April was worse than March in all countries, and May was
                slightly better in almost all countries, except for Cambodia and Indonesia, where the pandemic seemed to
                have gotten worse every following month.</p>
            <hr>
            <span id="relevance" class="about-title">Which were the relevant aspects in the analyzed dataset?</span>
            <img src="assets/media/graphics/dataset-about-02.jpg">
            <p>For the development of this infopoetry, relevant features were identified with the goal of showing the
                estimated relationship between the number of workers and the wage gap (between March and May 2020) for
                each country analyzed. The selected data, therefore, aims to highlight the hardships faced by workers
                involved in the report and their exploitation by the brands most well-known to the public.</p>
            <hr>
            <span id="metaphor" class="about-title">The data was encoded via one of the most common products in the global garment industry: a set of T-Shirts.</span>
            <p>More specifically, the data was encoded using two different approaches. The first is the physical object
                cut: the length of the T-Shirt is directly proportional to the average estimated wage gap in percentage
                during the analyzed time-range. In contrast, the second is label length which is directly proportional
                to the estimated workers per Country. The goal was to create a contrast between the amount of people and
                the wage gap through two physical histograms (T-Shirt cut and label design).</p>
            <img src="assets/media/graphics/wagegap.png">
            <img src="assets/media/graphics/labeldesign.png">
            <p>The page of each T-Shirt contains: short description (number of workers and estimated wage gap for each
                country in percentage), price (average monthly wage in USD) and size (estimated average wage gap in
                USD). This last one was identified according to a predetermined range. So, lost wages aims to be a sort
                of solidarity campaign: by purchasing a T-shirt, the user can bridge the wage gap of a worker in the
                represented country.</p>
            <img src="assets/media/graphics/dataset-project.jpg">
            <hr>
            <span id="artifact" class="about-title">The purpose of <span class="font-regular">Lost wages</span> is to demonstrate the breadth of the wage gap workers face.</span>
            <p>This infopoetry is dedicated to visualizing the consequences of Covid-19 pandemic on garment industry
                workers, by showing the wage gap percentage of millions of workers from the most productive countries.
                The concept stems from the desire to provoke and make people reflect on what is hidden behind the
                production of clothing that we usually buy and wear. From this message, follows the choice of metaphor
                and media through which to present it: a dystopian store similar in appearance to those we browse daily
                to buy our clothes, but where the products have a story to tell and are carriers of information relating
                to human exploitation.</p>
